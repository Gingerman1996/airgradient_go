## 3 Description

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 are highly-integrated
2A switch-mode battery charge management and
system power path management devices for single
cell Li-ion and Li-polymer batteries. The solution is
highly integrated with built-in current sensing, loop
compensation, input reverse-blocking FET (RBFET,
Q1), high-side switching FET (HSFET, Q2), low-
side switching FET (LSFET, Q3), and battery FET
(BATFET, Q4) between system and battery. The
device uses narrow VDC power path management,
regulating the system slightly above the battery
voltage without dropping below a configurable
minimum system voltage. The low impedance power
path optimizes switch-mode operation efficiency,
reduces battery charging time, extends battery life
during discharging phase, and the ultra-low 0.15μA
ship mode current extends battery shelf life. The I^2 C
serial interface with charging and system settings
makes BQ25628 and BQ25629 truly flexible solutions.

## 4 Description (continued)

```
The BQ25628 has the ILIM pin to set the default input current limit and TS_BIAS pin for controlled thermistor
bias. The BQ25629 supports a wide range of input sources, including standard USB host port and USB charging
port. The device is compliant with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power specifications for input current and voltage
regulation and meets the USB On-the-Go (OTG) operation power rating specification up to 2.0A.
```
```
The power path management regulates the system slightly above battery voltage but does not drop below
the programmable minimum system voltage. With this feature, the system maintains operation even when the
battery is completely depleted or removed. When the input current limit or input voltage limit is reached, the
power path management automatically reduces the charge current. As the system load continues to increase,
the battery starts to discharge until the system power requirement is met. This supplement mode prevents
overloading the input source.
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 power an accessory attached to PMID either directly from the adapter or from
the battery in either boost or bypass OTG modes. Boost OTG provides a regulated voltage at PMID from the
battery via boost operation in the converter. Bypass OTG provides a direct path from the battery to PMID for
highest efficiency. The BQ25628 and BQ25629 may be configured to automatically transition into boost OTG
mode when the adapter is removed, and back into forward charging when the adapter is attached in order
to power PMID in either configuration without host intervention. In forward charging, boost OTG and bypass
OTG, the PMID_GD signal indicates PMID voltage and current are within accepted ranges. PMID_GD may be
used to drive an external PMOS FET to protect attached accessories by disconnecting them from PMID if an
out-of-range voltage or current is detected.
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 initiate and complete a charging cycle without host control. By sensing the battery
voltage, it charges the battery in four different phases: trickle charge, pre-charge, constant current (CC) charge
and constant voltage (CV) charge. At the end of the charging cycle, the charger automatically terminates when
the charge current is below a preset threshold and the battery voltage is higher than the recharge threshold.
Termination is supported for all TS pin temperature zones.
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 provide various safety features for battery charging and system operations,
including battery negative temperature coefficient thermistor monitoring, charging safety timer and overvoltage
and overcurrent protections. The thermal regulation reduces charge current when the junction temperature
exceeds the programmable threshold. The STAT output reports the charging status and any fault conditions.
Other safety features include battery temperature sensing for charge mode and OTG boost mode, thermal
shutdown and input UVLO and overvoltage protection. The INT output notifies the host when a fault occurs or
status changes.
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 are available in a 18-pin, 2.5mm × 3.0mm WQFN package.

### 8.3 Feature Description...................................................

**_8.3.1 Power-On-Reset (POR)_**

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 power internal bias circuits from the higher voltage of VBUS and BAT. When either
voltage rises above its undervoltage lockout (UVLO) threshold, all registers are reset to their POR values and
the I^2 C interface is enabled for communication. A non-maskable INT pulse is generated, after which the host can
access all of the registers.
```
**_8.3.2 Device Power Up from Battery_**

```
If only the battery is present and the VBAT is above depletion threshold (VBAT_UVLOZ), the BQ25628 and
BQ25629 perform a power-on reset then turns on the BATFET to connect the battery to system. The REGN LDO
output remains off to minimize the quiescent current. The low RDSON of BATFET and the low quiescent current
on BAT minimize the conduction loss and maximize the battery run time.
```
**_8.3.3 Device Power Up from Input Source_**

```
When a valid input source is plugged in with VBAT < VBAT_UVLOZ, the BQ25628 and BQ25629 perform a
power-on reset then checks the input source voltage to turn on the REGN LDO and all the bias circuits. It detects
and sets the input current limit before the buck converter is started. The power up sequence from input source is
as listed:
```
1. REGN LDO power up (Section 8.3.3.1)
2. Poor source qualification (Section 8.3.3.2)
3. Input voltage limit threshold setting (Section 8.3.3.5)
4. Converter power-up (Section 8.3.3.6)

```
8.3.3.1 REGN LDO Power Up
```
```
The REGN LDO regulator supplies internal bias circuits as well as the HSFET and LSFET gate drive. The REGN
LDO also provides bias rail to TS external resistors. The pull-up rail of STAT can be connected to REGN as well.
The REGN is enabled when all the below conditions are valid:
```
- VBUS above VVBUS_UVLOZ
- VBUS above VBAT + VSLEEPZ
- EN_HIZ = 0
- After 220-ms delay is completed

```
If any one of the above conditions is not valid, the REGN LDO and the converter power stage remain off with the
converter disabled. In this state, the battery supplies power to the system.
```
```
8.3.3.2 Poor Source Qualification
```
```
After the REGN LDO powers up, the device checks the current capability of the input source. The input source
has to meet the following requirements in order to move forward to the next power on steps.
```
1. VBUS voltage below VVBUS_OVP
2. VBUS voltage above VPOORSRC when pulling IPOORSRC

Once these conditions are met, the device proceeds to input source type detection.

```
8.3.3.3 D+/D– Detection Sets Input Current Limit (BQ25629)
```
```
After the REGN LDO is powered, the adapter has been qualified as a good source, and AUTO_INDET_EN
bit = 1 (POR default), BQ25629 runs input source detection through D+/D– lines to detect USB Battery
Charging Specification 1.2 (BC1.2) input sources (CDP / SDP / DCP) and non-standard adapters. The detection
algorithm runs automatically each time that VBUS is plugged in, updating the IINDPM according to Table 8-2. If
AUTO_INDET_EN = 0, the detection algorithm is not run and IINDPM remains unchanged. The host can force
the detection algorithm to run and update IINDPM by setting FORCE_INDET to 1.

```
The USB BC1.2 is able to identify Standard Downstream Port (SDP), Charging Downstream Port (CDP), and
Dedicated Charging Port (DCP). When the Data Contact Detection (DCD) timer of 500ms is expired, the
non-standard adapter detection is applied to set the input current limit.
```
```
The secondary detection is used to distinguish two types of charging ports (CDP and DCP). Most of the time, a
CDP requires the portable device (such as smart phone, tablet) to send back an enumeration within 2.5 seconds
of CDP plug-in. Otherwise, the port reverts back to SDP even though the D+/D– detection indicates CDP.
```
Upon the completion of input source type detection, the following registers are changed:

1. Input Current Limit (IINDPM) register is changed to set current limit
2. VBUS_STAT bits are updated to indicate the detected input source type

```
After detection completes, the host can over-write the IINDPM register to change the input current limit if
needed.

If DCP is detected (VBUS_STAT = 011), BQ25629 turns on VD+D-_0p6V_SRC on D+ if EN_DCP_BIAS is set to

1. Setting EN_DCP_BIAS to 0 while VBUS_STAT = 011 disables the VD+D-_0p6V_SRC on D+ pin, and setting
EN_DCP_BIAS to 1 while VBUS_STAT = 011 enables the VD+D-_0p6V_SRC on D+ pin. The EN_HIZ bit has priority
over EN_DCP_BIAS.

```
The non-standard detection is used to distinguish vendor specific adapters based on their unique dividers on the
D+/D- pins. Comparators detect the voltage applied on each pin and determine the input current limit according
to Table 8-1.

8.3.3.4 ILIM Pin (BQ25628 Only)
```
```
The ILIM pin clamps the input current limit to IINREG = KILIM / RILIM, where RILIM is connected from the ILIM
pin to GND. The ILIM pin can be used to limit the input current limit from 100 mA - 3.2 A. The input current
is limited to the lower of the two values set by the ILIM pin and IINDPM register bits. The ILIM pin can also
be used to monitor input current. The input current is proportional to the voltage on the ILIM pin and can be
calculated by IIN = (KILIM x VILIM) / (RILIM x 0.8). The ILIM pin function is disabled when the EN_EXTILIM bit is
set to 0. In BQ25628, if the ILIM pin voltage exceeds VILIM_OCP (900mV), the device detects input over current.
The converter drives PMID_GD high and clears the OTG_FAULT_STAT bit to 0.
```
An RC filter in parallel with RILIM is required when the input current setting on the ILIM pin is either:

- below 400 mA or
- above 2 A when using a 2.2-μH inductor

The value for the RC filter is 1.2 kΩ and 330 nF, respectively.

```
8.3.3.5 Input Voltage Limit Threshold Setting (VINDPM Threshold)
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 support a wide range of input voltage limit (3.8 V – 16.8 V). Its POR default
VINDPM threshold is set at 4.6 V. The BQ25628 and BQ25629 also support dynamic VINDPM tracking, which
tracks the battery voltage to ensure a sufficient margin between input and battery voltages for proper operation
of the buck converter. This function is enabled via the VINDPM_BAT_TRACK register bit. When enabled, the
actual input voltage limit is the higher of the VINDPM register or VINDPM_BAT_TRACK (VBAT + 400-mV typical
offset.)
```
```
8.3.3.6 Converter Power-Up
```
```
After the input current and voltage limits are set, the converter is enabled and the HSFET and LSFET start
switching. If battery charging is disabled, the BATFET turns off. Otherwise, the BATFET stays on to charge the
battery. Converter startup requires the following conditions:
```
- VBUS has passed poor source qualification (refer to Section 8.3.3.2)
- VBUS > VBAT + VSLEEPZ
- VVBUS < VVBUS_OVP
- EN_HIZ = 0
- VSYS < VSYS_OVP
- TJ < TSHUT

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 provide soft start when the system rail is ramped up by setting IINDPM to its lowest
programmable value and stepping up through each available setting until reaching the value set by IINDPM
register. Concurrently, the system short protection limits the output current to approximately 0.5 A when the
system rail is below VSYS_SHORT.
```
```
The device uses a highly efficient 1.5-MHz, fixed frequency pulse width modulated (PWM) step-down switching
regulator. The internally compensated feedback loop keep tight control of the switching frequency under all
conditions of input voltage, battery voltage, charge current and temperature, simplifying output filter design.
```
```
The device switches to pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control at light load condition. The PFM_FWD_DIS
and PFM_OTG_DIS bit can be used to disable the PFM operation in buck and boost respectively.
```
**_8.3.4 Power Path Management_**

```
The BQ25628 accommodate a wide range of input sources from a USB, wall adapter, wireless charger, to car
charger. They provide automatic power path selection to supply the system from an input source, battery, or
both.

```
8.3.4.1 Narrow VDC Architecture
```
```
The BQ25628 use the Narrow VDC architecture (NVDC) with BATFET separating system from battery. The
minimum system voltage is set by VSYSMIN register setting. Even with a fully depleted battery, the system is
regulated to the minimum system voltage. If charging is enabled, the BATFET operates in linear mode (LDO
mode). The default minimum system voltage at POR is 3.52 V.
```
```
As the battery voltage rises above the minimum system voltage, the BATFET is turned fully on. When battery
charging is disabled and VBAT is above the minimum system voltage setting, or charging is terminated, the
system is regulated 50 mV (typical) above battery voltage.
```
```
8.3.4.2 Dynamic Power Management
```
```
To meet the USB maximum current limit and avoid overloading the adapter, the device features Dynamic Power
Management (DPM), which continuously monitors the input current and input voltage. When the input source
is overloaded, either the current exceeds the input current limit (IINDPM) or the voltage falls below the input
voltage limit (VINDPM). The device then reduces the charge current until the input current falls below the input
current limit and the input voltage rises above the input voltage limit.
```
```
When the charge current is reduced to zero, but the input source is still overloaded, the system voltage starts
to drop. Once the system voltage falls below the battery voltage by VSUPP, the device automatically enters the
supplement mode where the BATFET turns on and the battery starts discharging so that the system is supported
from both the input source and battery.
```
```
8.3.4.3 High Impedance Mode
```
```
The host may place the BQ25628 into high impedance mode by writing EN_HIZ = 1. In high impedance mode,
RBFET (Q1), HSFET (Q2) and LSFET (Q3) are turned off. The RBFET and HSFET block current flow to and
from VBUS, putting the VBUS pin into a high impedance state. The BATFET (Q4) is turned on to connect the
BAT to SYS. During high impedance mode, REGN is disabled and the digital clock is slowed to conserve power.
```
BQ25628 drives PMID_GD low in high-impedance mode.

**_8.3.5 Battery Charging Management_**

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 charge a 1-cell Li-Ion battery with up to a 2.0-A charge current. The 15-mΩ
BATFET improves charging efficiency and minimizes the voltage drop during discharging.
```
```
8.3.5.1 Autonomous Charging Cycle
```
```
When battery charging is enabled (EN_CHG bit = 1 and CE pin is LOW), the BQ25628 and BQ25629
autonomously complete a charging cycle without host involvement. The device default charging parameters are
listed in Table 8-3. The host can always control the charging operations and optimize the charging parameters by
writing to the corresponding registers through I^2 C.
```
**Table 8-3. Charging Parameter Default Setting**

A new charge cycle starts when the following conditions are valid:

- Converter starts per the conditions in Section 8.3.3.6
- EN_CHG = 1
- CE pin is low
- No thermistor fault on TS
- No safety timer fault

```
regulation. When a fully charged battery is discharged below VRECHG, the device automatically starts a new
charging cycle. After charging terminates, toggling CE pin or EN_CHG bit also initiates a new charging cycle.
```
```
The STAT output indicates the charging status. Refer to Section 8.3.8.2 for details of STAT pin operation.
In addition, the status register (CHG_STAT) indicates the different charging phases: 00-charging disabled or
terminated, 01-constant current, 10 constant voltage, 11-topoff charging.
```
```
8.3.5.2 Battery Charging Profile
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 charge the battery in five phases: trickle charge, pre-charge, constant current,
constant voltage and an optional top-off charging phase. At the beginning of a charging cycle, the device checks
the battery voltage and regulates current and voltage accordingly.

8.3.5.3 Charging Termination
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 terminate a charge cycle when the battery voltage is above recharge threshold,
and the current is below ITERM. To avoid early termination, the BQ25628 and BQ25629 do not terminate while
IINDPM, VINDPM or thermal regulation loops are active. After the charging cycle is completed, the BATFET
turns off. The converter keeps running to power the system, and the BATFET can turn on again to engage
supplement mode. Termination can be permanently disabled by writing 0 to EN_TERM bit prior to charge
termination.
```
```
At low termination currents, due to the comparator offset, the actual termination current may be 10 mA to 20 mA
higher than the termination target. In order to compensate for comparator offset, a programmable top-off timer
can be applied after termination is detected. The top-off timer follows safety timer constraints, such that if the
safety timers suspend, so does the top-off timer. Similarly, if the safety timers count at half-clock rate, so does
the top-off timer. Refer to Section 8.3.5.5 for the list of conditions. The host can read CHG_STAT to find out the
termination status.
```
Top-off timer gets reset by any of the following conditions:

1. Charging cycle stop and restart (toggle CE pin, toggle EN_CHG bit, charged battery falls below recharge
    threshold or adapter removed and replugged)
2. Termination status low to high
3. REG_RST register bit is set

```
The top-off timer settings are read in after is detected by the charger. Programming a top-off timer value after
termination has no effect unless a recharge cycle is initiated. CHG_FLAG is set to 1 when entering top-off timer
segment and again when the top-off timer expires.
```
```
8.3.5.4 Thermistor Qualification
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 provide a single thermistor input for battery temperature monitoring. The TS pin
input of the battery temperature can be ignored by the charger if TS_IGNORE = 1. When the TS pin feedback
is ignored, the charger considers the TS to always be valid for charging mode and OTG mode, and TS_STAT
always reports 000. The TS pin may be left floating if TS_IGNORE is set to 1.
```
```
When TS_IGNORE=1, the TS_ADC channel is disabled, with TS_ADC_DIS forced to 1; Attempting to write to 0
is ignored.
```
```
When TS_IGNORE = 0, the charger adjusts the charging profile based on the TS pin feedback information
according to the configurable profile described in Section 8.3.5.4.1. When the battery temperature crosses from
one temperature range to another, TS_STAT is updated accordingly, and the charger sets the FLAG bit for the
newly-entered temperature range. If TS_MASK is set to 0, any change to TS_STAT, including a transition to
TS_NORMAL, generates an INT pulse.
```
```
8.3.5.4.1 Advanced Temperature Profile in Charge Mode
```
```
To improve the safety of charging Li-ion batteries, JEITA guideline was released on April 20, 2007. The guideline
emphasized the importance of avoiding a high charge current and high charge voltage at certain low and
high temperature ranges. As battery technology continues to evolve, battery manufacturers have released
temperature safety specifications that extend beyond the JEITA standard. The BQ25628 and BQ25629 feature
a highly flexible temperature-based charging profile to meet these advanced specifications while remaining
backwards compatible with the original JEITA standard. Figure 8-3 shows the programmability for charger
behavior under different battery temperature (TS) operating regions.

Charging safety timer is adjusted within the temperature zones to reflect changes to the charging current. When
IPRECHG and ICHG are reduced to 20% or 40% in the cool or warm temperature zones, the charging safety
timer counts at half rate. If charging is suspended, the safety timer is suspended, the STAT pin blinks and
CHG_STAT is set to 00 (not charging or charge terminated.)

The value of RT1 and RT2 are determined from the resistance of the thermistor at 0 and 60ºC (RTH0degC and
RTH60degC) and the corresponding voltage thresholds VTS_0degC and VTS_60degC (expressed as percentage of
REGN with value between 0 and 1). For the most accurate thermistor curve fitting, use the rising threshold
for VTS_COLD at 0ºC and the falling threshold for VTS_HOT at 60ºC, regardless of the actual register settings for
TS_TH1_TH2_TH3 and TS_TH4_TH5_TH6.

Assuming a 103AT NTC thermistor on the battery pack, the RT1 and RT2 are calculated to be 5.23 kΩ and 30.1

```
```
If the thermistor is biased from TS_BIAS, the maximum current should be checked against ITS_BIAS_FAULT. For
the worst-case condition of thermistor at 0-Ω impedance (very hot), the bias current is :

For 5.30-kΩ RT1, this has a maximum IBIAS of 0.94 mA, which is well below the minimum ITS_BIAS_FAULT
threshold. The 103AT NTC thermistor is the recommended thermistor and has 10-kΩ nominal impedance. Using
a lower impedance thermistor will change the value of R1 and may produce a bias current that exceeds the
TS_BIAS pin fault threshold. TS_STAT[2:0] is set to 111.
```
```
8.3.5.4.3 Cold/Hot Temperature Window in OTG Mode
```
```
For battery protection during boost OTG and bypass OTG modes, BQ25628 and BQ25629 monitor the
battery temperature to be within the TS_TH_OTG_COLD to TS_TH_OTG_HOT register settings. For a
103AT NTC thermistor with RT1 of 5.23 kΩ and RT2 of 30.1 kΩ, TS_TH_OTG_COLD default is -10°C and
TS_TH_OTG_HOT default is 60°C. When temperature is outside of this range, the OTG mode is suspended
with REGN remaining on. In addition, VBUS_STAT bits are set to 000, TS_STAT is set to 001 (TS_OTG_COLD)
or 010 (TS_OTG_HOT), and TS_FLAG is set. In bypass OTG, PMID_GD drives low and the HSFET is disabled.
Once the battery temperature returns to normal temperature, the boost OTG or bypass OTG is restarted and
TS_STAT returns to 000 (TS_NORMAL).

8.3.5.4.4 JEITA Charge Rate Scaling
```
```
The TS_ISET_PRECOOL, TS_ISET_COOL, TS_ISET_PREWARM and TS_ISET_WARM cool and warm
charge current fold backs are based on a 1C charging rate. The 1C rate is the battery capacity in mA-hours
divided by 1 hour, so that a 500 mA-hour battery would have a 1C charging rate of 500 mA. The same battery
would have a 2C charging rate of 1,000 mA. In order to convert the charging foldback, the host must set the
CHG_RATE register to the C rate for the battery. This scales the foldback accordingly.
```
```
When TS_ISET_PRECOOL, TS_ISET_COOL, TS_ISET_PREWARM or TS_ISET_WARM is set to either 00

8.3.5.4.5 TS_BIAS Pin
```
```
The The BQ25628 has the TS_BIAS pin to isolate the battery temperature sensing thermistor and associated
resistor-divider from REGN. The 103AT thermistor with typical resistor-divider network requires about 400 μA
to bias. The BQ25628 provides the TS_BIAS pin, which is internally connected to the REGN LDO via a back-to-
back MOSFET switch. When no temperature measurement is being taken, the switch is disabled to disconnect
the thermistor and resistor-divider from the REGN LDO, saving the 400-μA bias current from being expended
unnecessarily.
```
```
The TS_BIAS pin has short-circuit protection. If a short is detected on the TS_BIAS pin, the switch is disabled
to disconnect the short from REGN. If this condition occurs, TS_STAT register is set to 0x3. Charging and OTG
modes are suspended until the short is removed.

```
8.3.5.5 Charging Safety Timers
```
```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 have three built-in safety timers to prevent extended charging cycle due to
abnormal battery conditions. The fast charge safety timer and pre-charge safety timers are set through I^2 C
CHG_TMR and PRECHG_TMR fields, respectively. The trickle charge timer is fixed at 1 hour.
```
```
The trickle charging, pre-charging and fast charging safety timers can be disabled by setting
EN_SAFETY_TMRS = 0. EN_SAFETY_TMRS can be enabled anytime regardless of which charging stage
the charger is in. Each timer starts to count as soon as the following two conditions are simultaneously true:
EN_SAFETY_TMRS=1 and the corresponding charging stage is active.
```
```
When either the fast charging, trickle charging or pre-charging safety timer expires, the SAFETY_TMR_STAT
and SAFETY_TMR_FLAG bits are set to 1.
```
```
Events that cause a reduction in charging current also cause the charging safety timer to count at half-clock rate
if TMR2X_EN bit is set.
```
```
During faults which suspend charging, the charge, pre-charge and trickle safety timers are also suspended,
regardless of the state of the TMR2X_EN bit. Once the fault goes away, charging resumes and the safety timer
resumes from where it stopped.
```
```
The charging safety timer and the charging termination can be disabled at the same time. Under this condition,
the charging keeps running until it is disabled by the host.
```
**_8.3.6 USB On-The-Go (OTG)_**

```
8.3.6.1 Boost OTG Mode
```
```
BQ25628 and BQ25629 support boost converter operation to deliver power from the battery to PMID. The output
voltage is set in VOTG. VBUS_STAT is set to 111 upon a successful entry into boost OTG. The boost operation
is enabled when the following conditions are met:
```
1. BAT above VBAT_OTG
2. VBUS less than VBAT+VSLEEP
3. Boost mode operation is enabled (EN_OTG = 1)
4. VTS_OTG_HOT < VTS < VTS_OTG_COLD
5. VREGN > VREGN_OK
6. 30 ms delay after EN_OTG = 1
7. Boost mode regulation voltage in REG0x0C is greater than 105% of battery voltage.

```
8.3.6.2 Bypass OTG Mode
```
```
In addition to boost OTG mode, the BQ25628 and BQ25629 provide bypass mode to directly connect the battery
to PMID pin through BATFET and HSFET. The low impedance path in bypass mode achieves the highest
efficiency when powering up external accessories, and maximizes the battery run time. During bypass OTG
mode, the status register VBUS_STAT is set to 111.
```
Bypass OTG mode is entered when:

- VBAT > VBAT_OTG
- VVBUS < VBAT+VSLEEP
- OTG mode has been enabled (EN_OTG=1) and bypass mode is enabled (EN_BYPASS_OTG=1).
- VTS_OTG_HOT < VTS < VTS_OTG_COLD
- VREGN > VREGN_OK
- 30 ms delay after EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1, bypass OTG is enabled by turning on HSFET and
    BATFET.

```
Any of the following conditions will exit from bypass OTG. Unless otherwise indicated, exit from bypass mode
leads into battery-only mode by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0:
```
- OTG mode is disabled (EN_OTG=0)

**[http://www.ti.com](http://www.ti.com)**
SLUSEG4C – DECEMBER 2022 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2025

- Bypass OTG mode is disabled (EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0) will cause exit into boost OTG mode if EN_OTG
    remains at 1.
- Entry into shutdown, ship mode or system power reset will exit from bypass OTG by setting EN_OTG =
    EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0 and then enter into shutdown, ship mode or system power reset as selected.

```
BQ25628 and BQ25629 can be configured to automatically transition between charging mode and bypass OTG
mode by setting EN_CHG = 1, EN_OTG = 1 and EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1. When the adapter plugs in, and all
conditions to start a new charge cycle are valid, the device automatically transitions to charging mode. If the
adapter is removed and bypass enable conditions are valid, the device automatically transitions to bypass OTG
mode to power the accessories connected to PMID.
```
```
8.3.6.3 PMID Voltage Indicator (PMID_GD)
```
```
In BQ25628 and BQ25629, accessory devices can be connected to charger PMID pin to get power either from
the adapter through Q1 direct path or from battery boost mode. An optional external PMOS FET can be placed
between the PMID pin and accessory input to disconnect the power path during over-current and over-voltage
conditions. PMID_GD is used to drive this external PMOS FET through an inverter. PMID_GD HIGH turns on an
inverter to pull the PMOS FET gate low to turn on PMOS FET, and PMID_GD LOW turns off the PMOS FET.
```
```
Upon adapter plug-in, PMID_GD goes from LOW to HIGH when VBUS rises above VBAT but below VPMID_OVP
and passes poor source detection. An adapter voltage that is greater than VPMID_OVP but less than VVBUS_OVP
will drive PMID_GD low, but will charge the battery if all other conditions are valid. In this state, the external
PMOS FET will stay off to protect the accessory from over-voltage fault.
```
```
When the adapter is removed, PMID_GD goes LOW before battery boost mode starts. In battery boost mode,
the device regulates PMID voltage to the VOTG register setting as a stable power supply to the accessory
devices. PMID_GOOD goes from LOW to HIGH when PMID voltage rises above VOTG_UVPZ. Once PMID voltage
is out of this range, PMID_GOOD goes LOW to disconnect the accessory device from PMID. During boost
mode, any of the conditions to exit boost mode will also drive PMID_GD from HIGH to LOW. See Section 8.3.6.1
for a list of these conditions.
```
```
If the device enters bypass OTG mode, the PMID_GD goes from LOW to HIGH when HSFET (Q2) is enabled.
During bypass OTG mode, any conditions to exit will also drive PMID_GD from HIGH to LOW. See Section
8.3.6.2 for a list of these conditions.
```
**_8.3.7 Integrated 12-Bit ADC for Monitoring_**

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 provide an integrated 12-bit ADC for the host to monitor various system
parameters.
```
```
To enable the ADC, the ADC_EN bit must be set to ‘1’. The ADC is disabled by default (ADC_EN = 0) to
conserve power. The ADC is allowed to operate if either VBUS > VPOORSRC or VBAT > VBAT_LOWV is valid.
If ADC_EN is set to ‘1’ before VBUS or VBAT reach their respective valid thresholds, then ADC_EN stays '0'.
When the charger enters HIZ mode, the ADC is temporarily suspended.
```
```
At battery only condition, if the TS_ADC channel is enabled, the ADC only operates when the battery voltage is
higher than 3.2 V (the minimal value to turn on REGN), otherwise, the ADC operates when the battery voltage is
higher than VBAT_LOWV.
```
```
The ADC_DONE_STAT, ADC_DONE_FLAG bits are set when a conversion is complete in one-shot mode only.
During continuous conversion mode, the ADC_DONE_STAT, ADC_DONE_FLAG bits have no meaning and
remain at 0. In one-shot mode, the ADC_EN bit is set to 0 at the completion of the conversion, at the same time
as the ADC_DONE_FLAG bit is set. In continuous mode, the ADC_EN bit remains at 1 until the user disables
the ADC by setting it to 0.

```
field reports the status at the time that it is read. The flag bit is latched and, once set to 1, will remain at 1 until
the host reads the bit, which will clear it to 0. The mask bit determines whether or not an interrupt pulse will be
generated when the flag bit is set.
```
**Figure 8-6. Relationship Between STAT, FLAG, and MASK**

```
The flag bit is set upon certain transitions of the status field. These transitions also generate an INT pulse if the
associated mask bit is set to 0. Because the INT is generated from the status field transition and not the flag bit,
an INT pulse is sent to the host even if the associated flag is already set to 1 when the status transition occurs.
Details of this behavior are shown in Figure 8-6.
```
```
The default behavior is to generate a 256-μs INT pulse when any flag bit is set to 1. These pulses may be
masked out on a flag-by-flag basis by setting a flag's mask bit to 1. Setting the mask bit does not affect the
transition of the flag bit from 0 to 1, only the generation of the 256-μs INT pulse.
```
```
8.3.8.2 Charging Status Indicator (STAT)
```
```
The BQ25628 indicates charging state on the open drain STAT pin. The STAT pin can drive an LED. The STAT
pin function can be disabled via the DIS_STAT bit.
```
```

```
```
8.3.8.3 Interrupt to Host ( INT)
```
```
In many applications, the host does not continually poll the charger status registers. Instead, the INT pin may
be used to notify the host of a status change with a 256-μs INT pulse. Upon receiving the interrupt pulse,
the host may read the flag registers (Charger_Flag_X and FAULT_Flag_X) to determine the event that caused
the interrupt, and for each flagged event, read the corresponding status registers (Charger_Status_X and
FAULT_Status_X) to determine the current state. Once set to 1, the flag bits remain latched at 1 until they are
read by the host, which clears them. The status bits, however, are updated whenever there is a change to status
and always represent the current state of the system.
```
```
All of the INT events can be masked off to prevent INT pulses from being sent out when they occur, with the
exception of the initial power-up interrupt. Interrupt events are masked by setting their mask bit in registers
(Charger_Mask_X and FAULT_Mask_X). Events always cause the corresponding flag bit to be set to 1,
regardless of whether or not the interrupt pulse has been masked.
```
**_8.3.9 BATFET Control_**

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 have an integrated, bi-directionally blocking BATFET that can be turned off to
remove leakage current from the battery to the system. The BATFET is controlled by the BATFET_CTRL register
bits, and supports shutdown mode, ship mode and system power reset.

8.3.9.1 Shutdown Mode
```
```
For the lowest battery leakage current, the host can shut down the BQ25628 and BQ25629 by setting the
register bits BATFET_CTRL to 01. In this mode, the BATFET is turned off to prevent the battery from powering
the system, the I^2 C is disabled and the charger is totally shut down. The BQ25628 and BQ25629 can only be
woken up by plugging in an adapter. When the adapter is plugged in, the BQ25628 and BQ25629 start back up
with all register settings in their POR default.
```
```
After the host sets BATFET_CTRL to 01, the BATFET turns off after waiting either 25 ms or 12.5 s as configured
by BATFET_DLY register bit. Shutdown mode can only be entered when VVBUS < VVBUS_UVLO, regardless of the
BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS setting, which has no effect on shutdown mode entry. If the host writes BATFET_CTRL
= 01 with VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ, the request is ignored and the BATFET_CTRL bits are set back to 00.
```
```
If the host writes BATFET_CTRL to 01 while boost OTG or bypass OTG is active, the BQ25628 and
BQ25629 first exit from boost OTG by setting EN_OTG = 0 or exits from bypass OTG by setting EN_OTG
= EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0 and then enters shutdown mode.
```
```
QON has no effect during shutdown mode. The internal pull-up on the QON pin is disabled during shutdown to
prevent leakage through the pin.
```
```
8.3.9.2 Ship Mode
```
```
The host may place the BQ25628 and BQ25629 into ship mode by setting BATFET_CTRL = 10. In ship mode,
the BATFET is turned off to prevent the battery from powering the system, and the I^2 C is disabled. Ship mode

has slightly higher quiescent current than shutdown mode, but QON may be used to exit from ship mode. The
BQ25628 and BQ25629 are taken out of ship mode by either of these methods:
```
- Pulling the QON pin low for tSM_EXIT
- VVBUS > VVBUS_UVLOZ (adapter plug-in)

When the BQ25628 and BQ25629 exit from ship mode, the registers are reset to their POR values.

```
Ship mode is only entered when the adapter is not present. Setting BATFET_CTRL = 10 while VVBUS >
VVBUS_UVLOZ (adapter present) either disables the BATFET or has no immediate effect depending on the setting
of BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS.
```
```
8.3.9.3 System Power Reset
```
```
The BATFET functions as a load switch between battery and system when the converter is not running. By
changing the state of BATFET from on to off, systems connected to SYS can be power cycled. Any of the
following conditions initiates a system power reset:
```
- BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS = 1 and QON is pulled low for tQON_RST
- BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS = 1 and BATFET_CTRL = 11
- BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS = 0 and VBUS < VVBUS_UVLO simultaneously with QON pulled low for tQON_RST
- BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS = 0 and VBUS < VVBUS_UVLO and BATFET_CTRL = 11

**Figure 8-7. System Power Reset Timing**

```
When BATFET_CTRL_WVBUS is set to 1, system power reset proceeds if either BATFET_CTRL is set to 11 or
QON is pulled low for tQON_RST, regardless of whether VBUS is present or not. There is a delay of tBATFET_DLY
before initiating the system power reset. If QON is pulled low, there is no delay after the tQON_RST completes,
regardless of BATFET_DLY setting.
```
```
The system power reset can be initiated from the battery only condition, from OTG mode or from the forward
charging mode with adapter present. If the system power is reset when the charger is in boost OTG mode, the
boost OTG mode is first stopped by setting EN_OTG = 0. If the system power is reset when the charger is in
bypass OTG mode, the bypass OTG mode will first be terminated by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0.

8.3.10.1.1 Battery Undervoltage Lockout

rises above VBAT_UVLOZ or VVBUS rises above VVBUS_UVLOZ, I^2 C will be re-enabled and the registers are reset to
their POR values.
```
```
8.3.10.1.2 Battery Overcurrent Protection
```
```
The BQ25628 has a two-level battery overcurrent protection. The IBAT_PK threshold is set by IBAT_PK and
provides a fast (100 μs) protection for the battery discharging. IBATFET_OCP provides a slower (50 ms), fixed-
threshold protection for the BATFET. If the battery discharge current becomes higher than either threshold for its
protection timer, the BAT_FAULT_STAT and BAT_FAULT_FLAG fault register bits are set to 1, and the BATFET
enters hiccup mode with 100-ms off-time and ~1% on-time. The BAT_FAULT_STAT will return to 0 once the
BATFET is disabled for the hiccup mode. Once the BATFET is turned back on, the IBAT_PK and IBATFET_OCP
thresholds are re-evaluated. In boost OTG mode, if the battery discharging current is higher than either IBAT_PK
or IBATFET_OCP for their respective protection timers, the charger exits OTG mode by clearing the EN_OTG bit.
```
```
8.3.10.2 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Buck Mode
```
```
8.3.10.2.1 Input Overvoltage
```
```
If VBUS voltage rises above VVBUS_OVP, the converter stops switching to protect the internal power
MOSFETs and IPMID_LOAD discharge current is applied to bring down VBUS voltage. VBUS_FAULT_FLAG and
VBUS_FAULT_STAT are set to 1. When VBUS falls back below VVBUS_OVPZ, VBUS_FAULT_STAT will transition
to 0 and the converter will resume switching.
```
```
8.3.10.2.2 System Overvoltage Protection (SYSOVP)
```
```
When VSYS rises above the VSYS_OVP threshold (around 250 mV above VBAT when not charging) in forward
converter operation, the converter stops switching to limit voltage overshoot and applies ISYS_LOAD to pull down
the system voltage. VSYS_FAULT_FLAG and VSYS_FAULT_STAT are set to 1. Once VSYS drops below
VSYS_OVP, the converter resumes switching, the 30 mA discharge current is removed and VSYS_FAULT_STAT
transitions to 0.
```
```
8.3.10.2.3 Forward Converter Cycle-by-Cycle Current Limit
```
```
The converter has cycle-by-cycle peak overcurrent protection in the switching MOSFETs. In forward mode, if the
current through Q2 exceeds IHSFET_OCP, the converter will immediately turn off the high-side gate drive for the
remainder of the switching cycle. Normal switching resumes on the next switching cycle.
```
```
8.3.10.2.4 System Short
```
```
When the SYS voltage falls below VSYS_SHORT, the charger enters PFM operation to limit the output current to
approximately 0.5 A or less. SYS_FAULT_STAT and SYS_FAULT_FLAG bits are set to 1. If VSYS rises above
VSYS_SHORTZ, the converter exits forced PFM mode, and the SYS_FAULT_STAT bit is set to 0.
```
```
8.3.10.2.5 Battery Overvoltage Protection (BATOVP)
```
```
When VBAT transitions above VBAT_OVP, the BQ25628 disables charging by disabling the BATFET and applies
IBAT_LOAD current source to discharge excess BAT voltage. If battery voltage remains above the threshold ,
BAT_FAULT_FLAG is set to 1 and BAT_FAULT_STAT transitions to 1. Once VBAT falls below VBAT_OVPZ,
charging resumes and BAT_FAULT_STAT transitions back to 0.
```
```
8.3.10.2.6 Sleep and Poor Source Comparators
```
```
The sleep comparator is used to suspend the converter if the adapter voltage is insufficient to maintain buck
converter operation while charging the battery. If VVBUS falls below VBAT + VSLEEP , the converter stops switching,
and VBUS_FAULT_STAT and VBUS_FAULT_FLAG are set to 1. If VVBUS rises back above VBAT + VSLEEPZ , the
converter restarts,.
```
```
If VVBUS falls below VPOORSRC, the converter stops switching (if not already suspended and high due to the sleep
comparator), and the VBUS_STAT transitions to 000 and the device transitions to battery-only mode. If VVBUS
rises above VPOORSRC, it is a new adapter attach, and poor source qualification will be run. VBUS_STAT will be
determined by the adapter attach sequence as outlined in Section 8.3.3.

8.3.10.2.7 PMID OVP and VBUS Overcurrent
```
```
BQ25628 monitors two additional parameters in forward charging mode to protect circuitry attached at PMID:
PMID overvoltage and VBUS Overcurrent. The PMID OVP comparator protects circuitry attached to the PMID
pin by driving PMID_GD low to disable an optional external pass FET. If VPMID rises above VPMID_OVP the
converter drives PMID_GD low. BQ25628 sets OTG_FAULT_STAT and OTG_FAULT_FLAG = 1. When VPMID
drops below VPMID_OVPZ, the converter drives PMID_GD high and clears the OTG_FAULT_STAT bit to 0.
```
```
The VBUS overcurrent comparator monitors the input current. A short circuit at PMID will pull excessive current
from VBUS that cannot be blocked by the IINDPM regulation loop in the converter. When IVBUS exceeds
IVBUS_OCP or ILIM pin voltage exceeds VILIM_OCP (900mV), the converter drives PMID_GD low, and BQ25628
sets OTG_FAULT_STAT and OTG_FAULT_FLAG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.3 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Boost Mode
```
```
BQ25628 closely monitors VBUS, SYS and BAT voltages, as well as VBUS, BAT and LSFET currents to ensure
safe boost mode operation.
```
```
8.3.10.3.1 Boost Mode Overvoltage Protection
```
```
When the BQ25628 is in OTG mode, Q1 is off to block power from PMID to VBUS. BQ25628 uses two
comparators to sense OVP during OTG mode. The PMID_OTG_OVP comparator monitors for an overvoltage
condition at PMID (VPMID > VBOOST_PMID_OVP.) The VBUS_OTG_OVP comparator monitors for an overvoltage
condition at VBUS (VVBUS > VOTG_VBUS_OVP.) Even though RBFET is turned off during OTG mode on the
BQ25628, an overvoltage at VBUS may result in an overvoltage at PMID via propagation across the RBFET
body diode.
```
```
If an overvoltage persists, the status is updated and the converter powers down into a fault condition.
Overvoltage on PMID or VBUS will result in OTG_FAULT_STAT and OTG_FAULT_FLAG set to 1.
```
```
If VVBUS > VBAT+VSLEEP, BQ25628 will exit boost OTG and enter adapter qualification. If VBUS passes adapter
qualification (poor source detection), it will then enter forward charging mode. Even though the VVBUS >
VOTG_OVP overvoltage condition does not cause an exit from boost OTG, an adapter plugin will trip the longer
deglitch of the sleep comparator, and BQ25628 will exit from boost OTG for this reason.
```
```
8.3.10.3.2 Boost Mode Duty Cycle Protection
```
```
After an initial startup blanking period, BQ25628 monitors the PMID voltage during boost OTG mode to ensure
that PMID voltage remains sufficiently above VSYS to maintain the minimum duty cycle. If VPMID falls below
VBOOST_DUTY (105% VSYS typical), the converter stops and enters hiccup mode.
```
```
If the boost converter cannot recover from hiccup mode, EN_OTG bit is cleared and the device exits boost
mode. The host may attempt to restart boost OTG mode by setting EN_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.3.3 Boost Mode PMID Undervoltage Protection
```
```
During boost OTG mode, BQ25628 converter monitors PMID for undervoltage. If the PMID voltage falls below
VOTG_UVP, the converter stops and enters hiccup mode.
```
```
If the boost converter cannot recover from hiccup mode, EN_OTG bit is cleared and the device exits boost
mode. The host may attempt to restart boost OTG mode by setting EN_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.3.4 Boost Mode Battery Undervoltage
```
```
If VBAT falls below VBAT_OTGZ during OTG mode, the charger exits OTG mode by setting EN_OTG = 0, and
BAT_FAULT_STAT and BAT_FAULT_FLAG are set to 1. Setting EN_OTG = 1 while VBAT < VBAT_OTG will not
enter OTG and the EN_OTG bit will be cleared to 0. When the battery is charged above VBAT_OTG, OTG mode
may be entered by setting EN_OTG = 1.

8.3.10.3.5 Boost Converter Cycle-by-Cycle Current Limit
```
```
The converter has cycle-by-cycle peak overcurrent protection in the switching MOSFETs. In OTG mode, if the
current through Q3 exceeds ILSFET_OCP, the converter will immediately turn off the low-side gate drive for the
remainder of the switching cycle. Normal switching resumes on the next switching cycle.
```
```
8.3.10.3.6 Boost Mode SYS Short
```
```
If VSYS falls below VSYS_SHORT in boost OTG mode, BQ25628 immediately stops the boost converter, enters
hiccup mode, and sets SYS_FAULT_FLAG to 1.
```
```
If the boost converter cannot recover from hiccup mode, EN_OTG bit is cleared and the device exits boost
mode. The host may attempt to restart boost OTG mode by setting EN_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.4 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Bypass Mode
```
```
BQ25628 monitors many of the same voltages and currents in bypass OTG mode as it does in boost
OTG mode. Additionally, bypass mode implements reverse-current protection as described in the following
subsection.
```
```
8.3.10.4.1 Bypass Mode Overvoltage Protection
```
```
When the BQ25628 is in bypass OTG mode, Q1 is off to block power from PMID to VBUS. BQ25628 uses two
comparators to sense OVP. The PMID_OTG_OVP comparator monitors for an overvoltage condition at PMID
(VPMID > VBYPASS_PMID_OVP.) The VBUS_OTG_OVP comparator monitors for an overvoltage condition at VBUS
(VVBUS > VOTG_VBUS_OVP.) Even though RBFET is turned off during OTG mode on the BQ25628, an overvoltage
at VBUS may result in an overvoltage at PMID via propagation across the RBFET body diode.
```
If an overvoltage persists on VBUS BQ25628 exits bypass OTG by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0.

```
If overvoltage persists on PMID bypass OTG is suspended, and the device enters hiccup mode. If the device
cannot recover from hiccup mode, bypass OTG mode is exited by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0.
```
```
If VVBUS > VBAT+VSLEEP, BQ25628 will exit bypass OTG and enter adapter qualification. If VBUS passes
adapter qualification (poor source detection), it will then enter forward charging mode. Even though the VVBUS >
VOTG_OVP overvoltage condition does not cause an exit from bypass OTG, an adapter plugin will trip the longer
deglitch of the sleep comparator, and BQ25628 will exit from bypass OTG for this reason.
```
```
8.3.10.4.2 Bypass Mode Battery OCP
```
```
BQ25628 has a two-level battery overcurrent protection. The IBAT_PK threshold is set by IBAT_PK and provides
a fast (100 μs) protection for the battery discharging. IBATFET_OCP provides a slower (50 ms), fixed-threshold
protection for the BATFET. During bypass OTG mode, if the battery discharge current becomes higher than
either threshold, the BAT_FAULT_STAT and BAT_FAULT_FLAG fault register bits are set to 1, and BQ25628
exits from bypass OTG mode into battery-only mode by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0. The
BATFET remains on when BQ25628 transitions into battery-only mode. If IBAT remains above the IBAT_PK /
IBATFET_OCP threshold after exiting bypass OTG, then the BATFET is turned off. The host may re-enable bypass
OTG mode by setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.4.3 Bypass Mode Reverse-Current Protection
```
```
In bypass mode, BQ25628 monitors IHSFET for reverse-current into the battery. If current from PMID into the
battery exceeds IBYPASS_RCP , OTG_FAULT_STAT and OTG_FAULT_FLAG are set to 1, and PMID_GD is
driven low and HSFET is disabled in order to suspend bypass OTG mode and the device enters hiccup
mode. If the device cannot recover from hiccup mode then the converter exits bypass OTG mode by setting
EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0.
```
```
8.3.10.4.4 Bypass Mode Battery Undervoltage
```
```
In bypass mode, if VBAT falls below VBAT_OTG, the battery is considered depleted. OTG mode is exited by
setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0, and BAT_FAULT_STAT and BAT_FAULT_FLAG are set to 1.

```
Setting EN_OTG = EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1 while VBAT < VBAT_OTG will not enter OTG and the EN_OTG and
EN_BYPASS_OTG bits will be cleared to 0. When the battery is charged above VBAT_OTG, OTG mode may be
entered by setting EN_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.4.5 Bypass Mode SYS Short
```
```
If VSYS falls below VSYS_SHORT in bypass OTG mode, BQ25628 immediately drives PMID_GD low and
disables HSFET, and the device enters hiccup mode. If the device cannot recover from hiccup mode,
bypass OTG mode will be exited. The host may attempt to restart bypass OTG mode by setting EN_OTG =
EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.4.6 Bypass Mode REGN Fault
```
```
If VREGN falls below VREGN_OK during bypass OTG mode, PMID_GD is driven low and HSFET is disabled,
and the device enters hiccup mode. If the device cannot recover from hiccup mode it exits bypass OTG
mode by setting EN_BYPASS_OTG = 0. The host may re-enter boost OTG mode by setting EN_OTG =
EN_BYPASS_OTG = 1.
```
```
8.3.10.5 Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown
8.3.10.5.1 Thermal Protection in Buck Mode
```
```
The BQ25628 monitors the internal junction temperature TJ to avoid overheating the chip and limits the IC
junction temperature in buck mode. When the internal junction temperature exceeds the TREG thermal regulation
limit (TREG register configuration), the device lowers the charging current. During thermal regulation, the safety
timer runs at half the clock rate, and the TREG_FLAG and TREG_STAT bits are set to 1. Additionally, the device
has thermal shutdown to turn off the converter and BATFET when IC junction temperature exceeds TSHUT. The
fault bit TSHUT_FLAG is set to 1 and TSHUT_STAT transitions to 1. The BATFET and converter are re-enabled
when IC temperature is TSHUT_HYS below TSHUT, and TSHUT_STAT transitions to 0.
```
```
8.3.10.5.2 Thermal Protection in Boost Mode
```
```
The device monitors the internal junction temperature to provide thermal shutdown during boost mode. When
IC junction temperature exceeds TSHUT, the boost mode is disabled by setting EN_OTG bit low and BATFET
is turned off, and TSHUT_FLAG is set to 1. When IC junction temperature is below TSHUT - TSHUT_HYS, the
BATFET is enabled automatically to allow system to restore and the host can re-enable EN_OTG bit to recover.
```
```
8.3.10.5.3 Thermal Protection in Battery-Only Mode
```
```
The BQ25628 monitors the internal junction temperature TJ to avoid overheating the chip and limits the IC
junction temperature in battery-only mode. The device has thermal shutdown to turn off the BATFET when IC
junction temperature exceeds TSHUT. The fault bit TSHUT_FLAG is set to 1 and TSHUT_STAT transitions to 1.
The BATFET is re-enabled when IC temperature is TSHUT_HYS below TSHUT, and TSHUT_STAT transitions to 0.
```
### 8.4 Device Functional Modes..........................................

**_8.4.1 Host Mode and Default Mode_**

```
The device is a host controlled charger, but it can operate in default mode without host management. In default
mode, the device can be used as an autonomous charger with no host or while host is in sleep mode. When the
charger is in default mode, WD_STAT bit becomes HIGH, WD_FLAG is set to 1, and an INT is asserted low to
alert the host (unless masked by WD_MASK). The WD_FLAG bit would read as 1 upon the first read and then 0
upon subsequent reads. When the charger is in host mode, WD_STAT bit is LOW.
```
```
After power-on-reset, the device starts in default mode with watchdog timer expired. All the registers are in the
default settings.
```
```
In default mode, the device keeps charging the battery with default 1-hour trickle charging safety timer, 2-hour
pre-charging safety timer and the 12-hour fast charging safety timer. At the end of the 1-hour or 2-hour or
12-hour timer expired, the charging is stopped and the buck converter continues to operate to supply system
load.

```
A write to any I^2 C register transitions the charger from default mode to host mode, and initiates the watchdog
timer. All the device parameters can be programmed by the host. To keep the device in host mode, the host has
to reset the watchdog timer by writing 1 to WD_RST bit before the watchdog timer expires (WD_STAT bit is set),
or disable watchdog timer by setting WATCHDOG bits = 00.
```
```
When the watchdog expires, the device returns to default mode. The ICHG value is divided in half when the
watchdog timer expires, and a number of other fields are reset to their POR default values as shown in the notes
column of the register tables in Section 8.6. When watchdog timer expires, WD_STAT and WD_FLAG is set to 1,
and an INT is asserted low to alert the host (unless masked by WD_MASK).

Beside a register reset by the watchdog timer in default mode, the register and the timer can be reset to the
default value by writing the REG_RST bit to 1. The register bits, which can be reset by the REG_RST bit, are
noted in the Register Map section. After the register reset, the REG_RST bit goes back from 1 to 0 automatically.

### 8.5 Programming............................................................

**_8.5.1 Serial Interface_**

```
The BQ25628 and BQ25629 uses an I^2 C compatible interface for flexible charging parameter programming and
instantaneous device status reporting. I^2 C is a bi-directional 2-wire serial interface. Only two open-drain bus lines
are required: a serial data line (SDA), and a serial clock line (SCL).
```
```
The device has 7-bit I^2 C address 0x6A, receiving control inputs from a host device such as a micro-controller or
digital signal processor through register addresses 0x02 – 0x38. The host device initiates all transfers and the
charger responds. Register reads outside of these addresses return 0xFF. When the bus is free, both SDA and
SCL lines are HIGH.
```
```
The I^2 C interface supports standard mode (up to 100 kbits/s), fast mode (up to 400 kbits/s) and fast mode plus
(up to 1 Mbits/s.) These lines are pulled up to a reference voltage via pull-up resistor. The device I^2 C detection
thresholds support a communication reference voltage from 1.2 V to 5 V.
```
```
Due to the ultra low IQ when the device operates in low power mode, it is necessary ensure a minimum of
90μs between a START command and any subsequent START command on the I^2 C bus. The recommended
minimum tbuf (bus free time between a STOP and START condition) depends on the I^2 C mode:
```
- Standard mode (100 kbits/s):
    - No additional requirements
- Fast mode (400 kbits/s):
    - Increase I^2 C tbuf to at least 68 μs
    - If using repeated start commands, ensure I^2 C tsu:STA is at least 68 μs
- Fast mode plus (1 Mbits/s):
    - Increase I^2 C tbuf to at least 81 μs
    - If using repeated start commands, ensure I^2 C tsu:STA is at least 81 μs

```
These recommendations assume a successful I^2 C transaction. It is also necessary to ensure a minimum 90μs
time between two START commands in the case of a NACK.
```
```
8.5.1.1 Data Validity
```
```
The data on the SDA line must be stable during the HIGH period of the clock. The HIGH or LOW state of the
data line can only change when the clock signal on the SCL line is LOW. One clock pulse is generated for each
data bit transferred.
```
```

```
**Figure 8-9. Bit Transfer on the I**^2 **C Bus**

```
8.5.1.2 START and STOP Conditions
```
```
All transactions begin with a START (S) and are terminated with a STOP (P). A HIGH to LOW transition on the
SDA line while SCL is HIGH defines a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line when the
SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition.

```
START and STOP conditions are always generated by the host. The bus is considered busy after the START
condition, and free after the STOP condition.

**Figure 8-10. START and STOP Conditions on the I**^2 **C Bus**

```
8.5.1.3 Byte Format
```
```
Every byte on the SDA line must be 8 bits long. The number of bytes to be transmitted per transfer is
unrestricted. Each byte has to be followed by an ACKNOWLEDGE (ACK) bit. Data is transferred with the
Most Significant Bit (MSB) first. If target cannot receive or transmit another complete byte of data until it has
performed some other function, it can hold the SCL line low to force the host into a wait state (clock stretching).
Data transfer then continues when the target is ready for another byte of data and releases the SCL line.

**Figure 8-11. Data Transfer on the I**^2 **C Bus**

```
8.5.1.4 Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NACK)
```
```
The ACK signaling takes place after each transmitted byte. The ACK bit allows the target to signal the host that
the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent. All clock pulses, including the acknowledge
9 th clock pulse, are generated by the host.
```
```
The host releases the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so the target can pull the SDA line LOW and
it remains stable LOW during the HIGH period of this 9th clock pulse.
```
```
A NACK is signaled when the SDA line remains HIGH during the 9th clock pulse. The host can then generate
either a STOP to abort the transfer or a repeated START to start a new transfer.
```
```
8.5.1.5 Target Address and Data Direction Bit
```
```
After the START signal, a target address is sent. This address is 7 bits long, followed by the 8 bit as a data
direction bit (bit R/ W). A zero indicates a transmission (WRITE) and a one indicates a request for data (READ).
The device 7-bit address is defined as
```
```

```
```
9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
9.2.2.1 Inductor Selection
```
```
The 1.5-MHz switching frequency allows the use of small inductor and capacitor values to maintain an inductor
saturation current higher than the charging current (ICHG) plus half the ripple current (IRIPPLE):
```
ISAT ≥ ICHG + (1/2) IRIPPLE (4)

SLUSEG4C – DECEMBER 2022 – REVISED FEBRUARY 2025 **[http://www.ti.com](http://www.ti.com)**

```
The inductor ripple current depends on the input voltage (VVBUS), the duty cycle (D = VBAT/VVBUS), the switching
frequency (fS) and the inductance (L).
```
```

RIPPLE
```
```

́ (5)
```
```
The maximum inductor ripple current occurs when the duty cycle (D) is approximately 0.5. Usually inductor ripple
is designed between 20% and 40% of the maximum charging current as a trade-off between inductor size and
efficiency.
```
```
9.2.2.2 Input Capacitor
```
```
Design input capacitance to provide enough ripple current rating to absorb input switching ripple current. The
worst case RMS ripple current is half of the charging current when duty cycle is 0.5. If the converter does not
operate at 50% duty cycle, then the worst case capacitor RMS current ICin occurs where the duty cycle is closest
to 50% and can be estimated using Equation 6.
```
ICIN CHG=I ́ D (1 D) ́ - (6)

```
Low ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for input decoupling capacitor and should be
placed as close as possible to the drain of the high-side MOSFET (PMID) and source of the low-side MOSFET
(GND). Voltage rating of the capacitor must be higher than normal input voltage level. A rating of 25-V or higher
capacitor is preferred for 15 V input voltage. 10-μF ceramic capacitor is suggested for typical of 2.0A charging
current.
```
```
9.2.2.3 Output Capacitor
```
```
Ensure that the output capacitance has enough ripple current rating to absorb the output switching ripple current.
Equation 7 shows the output capacitor RMS current ICOUT calculation.

At certain input and output voltage and switching frequency, the voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the
output filter LC.
```
```
The charger device has internal loop compensation optimized for ≥ 10-μF ceramic output capacitor. The
preferred ceramic capacitor is 10-V rating, X7R or X5R.

#### 11 Layout

##### 11.1 Layout Guidelines...................................................

```
The switching node rise and fall times should be minimized for lowest switching loss. Proper layout of the
components to minimize high frequency current path loop (see Figure 11-1) is important to prevent electrical and
magnetic field radiation and high frequency resonant problems. Follow this specific order carefully to achieve the
proper layout.
```
1. For lowest switching noise during forward/charge mode, place the decoupling capacitor CPMID1 and then
    bulk capacitor CPMID2 positive terminals as close as possible to PMID pin. Place the capacitor ground
    terminal close to the GND pin using the shortest copper trace connection or GND plane on the same layer
    as the IC. See Figure 11-2.
2. For lowest switching noise during reverse/OTG mode, place the CSYS1 and CSYS2 output capacitors'
    positive terminals near the SYS pin. The capacitors' ground terminals must be via'd down through multiple
    vias to an all ground internal layer that returns to IC GND pin through multiple vias under the IC. See Figure
    11-2.
3. Since REGN powers the internal gate drivers, place the CREGN capacitor positive terminal close to REGN
    pin to minimize switching noise. The capacitor's ground terminal must be via'd down through multiple vias to
    an all ground internal layer that returns to IC GND pin through multiple vias under the IC. See Figure 11-2.
4. Place the CVBUS and CBAT capacitors positive terminals as close to the VBUS and BAT pins as possible.
    The capacitors' ground terminals must be via'd down through multiple vias to an all ground internal layer that
    returns to IC GND pin through multiple vias under the IC. See Figure 11-2.
5. Place the inductor input pin near the positive terminal of the SYS pin capacitors. Due to the PMID capacitor
    placement requirements, the inductor's switching node terminal must be via'd down with multiple via's to
    a second internal layer with a wide trace that returns to the SW pin with multiple vias. See Figure 11-3.
    Using multiple vias ensures that the via's additional resistance is negligible compared to the inductor's
    dc resistance and therefore does not impact efficiency. The vias additional series inductance is negligible
    compared to the inductor's inductance.
6. Place the BTST capacitor on the opposite side from the IC using vias to connect to the BTST pin and SW
    node. See Figure 11-4.
7. A separate analog GND plane for non-power related resistors and capacitors is not required if those
    components are placed away from the power components traces and planes.
8. Ensure that the I2C SDA and SCL lines are routed away from the SW node.

```
Additionally, it is important that the PCB footprint and solder mask for the BQ25628 cover the entire length of
each of the pins. GND, SW, PMID, SYS and BAT pins extend further into the package than the other pins. Using
the entire length of these pins reduces parasitic resistance and increases thermal conductivity from the package
into the board.

(1) Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle.

(2) Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance,

reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional
waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.

(3) RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4) Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum

column width.

(5) MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown.

Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6) Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two
combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
